## Attentionto Model

Version 8 and above players can send `attentionto` commands to focus their attention on a particular player. The command has the form:

```
(attentionto <TEAM> <UNUM>) | (attentionto off)
```

Where `<TEAM>` is

```
opp | our | l | r | left | right | <TEAM_NAME>
```

and `<UNUM>` is an integer identifying a member of the team specified. Players can only focus on one player at a time (each attentionto command overrides the previous) and cannot focus on themselves.

See [Sensor Models](sensor-models.md) in detail about the aural sensor.
